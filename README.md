# Beer Review Prediction Project

## Overview

The Beer Review Prediction Project aims to predict how people will rate different beers based on their characteristics, like Alcohol by Volume (ABV), International Bitterness Units (IBU) flavor profiles and etc.  
We use a technique called linear regression to find out how these features relate to the beer's overall review scores.

## Getting Started

To use this project, you need to have Python installed, along with some libraries. You can run the project in Google Colab or on your own computer.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Dataset

We use a dataset called `beer_profile_and_ratings.csv` in this project. It contains various features of beers along with their review ratings. Here are some of the columns in the dataset:

- `Name`: The name of the beer
- `Style`: The type of beer
- `Brewery`: The brewery that makes the beer
- `Beer Name (Full)`: The complete name of the beer
- `Description`: A short description of the beer
- `ABV`: Alcohol by Volume
- `Min IBU` and `Max IBU`: The bitterness levels
-  Additional features about flavor and aroma
- `review_overall`: The overall rating of the beer
- `number_of_reviews`: How many reviews the beer has received
